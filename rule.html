        <h2> Civil Promotion criteria</h2>
        <br />
        Unlike other promotions, civil engineering promotions tend to occur
        slowly. There are several factors to consider here. The person who does well gets
        promoted faster while the one who the not so competent has to keep trying to get
        on next rank.  If you’re working for a small local firm that focuses on surveying
        and residential development they may start letting you run smaller projects like septic
        field relocation even before you get your license. If however you’re at a larger company
        working on multiple million transportation or structural projects you should be aware
        that taking a project management role at that level takes a lot more experience beyond
        getting your license. Those jobs move much slower so it takes more time to see every
        phase of a job enough times to be ready to manage one.<br />

        <br />
        <h3>Junior Engineer</h3>
